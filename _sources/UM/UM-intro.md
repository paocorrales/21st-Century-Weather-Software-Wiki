# The Unified Model

The ACCESS modeling suite is reliant on the UK Met Office’s Unified Model (UM) for atmospheric simulations. 

The UM is a collection of Fortran-based executables built to simulate the future state of the atmosphere. It is designed to interface with land/surface and sea-surface data.

The model is so named (i.e. "Unified") because it contains a single set of code that can be applied across a diverse range of length and timescales; from urban weather forecasts at grid resolutions of a few hundred metres, to global climate model projections extending into next century at grid resolutions of hundreds of kilometres.

You can access more detailed information about the UM here : 
https://21centuryweather.github.io/UM_summary_docs/introduction.html

For now, let's concentrate on running a very simple test suite, a 'minimal working example' to demonstrate how we can run the UM on `gadi` using a `rose/cylc` suite.

## Quick Start Guide

To run the UM quickly.
- Start a persistent session on `gadi` and login to it.
- Pass MOSRS authentication
- Load your `cylc` modules
- `$ rosie co u-dl058`
- `$ cd ~/roses/u-dl058`
- In `~/roses/u-dl085/rose-suit.conf`, check you have write permissions to the folder `ARCHDIR`, defined as `/scratch/${PROJECT}/${USER}`. If you don't know your default `gadi` project, see [here](https://opus.nci.org.au/spaces/Help/pages/230490489/FAQ...#FAQ...-'Permissiondenied'messagewhenworkingonanewproject.1).
- `$ rose suite-run`

## Checking out a UM suite ##

If you need to, repeat the steps of the previous tutorial to login to your persistent session and authenticate your MOSRS credentials. Then, checkout suite `u-dl058` using
```
rosie co u-dl058
```
This suite was initially developed by scientists at the Bureau of Meteorology to research 'coupled' Numerical Weather Prediction using separate atmospheric and ocean models. For this tutorial, we have removed all `rose/cylc` logic related to ocean coupling so the suite performs a simple atmosphere/land simulation at low resolution.

## Examining the suite ##

The suite contains all the usual files you've become accustomed too inside a `rose/cylc` suite:
- A `rose-app.conf` file to control the master configuration of the suite.
- A `suite.rc` file to control the task flow
- An `app` directory to house `.conf` files for each application task.

Let's step through each task within this suite so we understand at a basic level, how the UM works on `gadi`.

### Master configuration ###

Let's quickly run through the master configuration file : `~/roses/u-dl085/rose-suite.conf`

This contains a list of `bash` environment variables which describe the following:
- `ANCILDATA` : Ancillary data directory
- `ARCHDIR` : Output archive directory
- `ARCHIVE_6HR` : Archiving temporal frequency
- `ATM_PPN` : Number of processors for atmospheric tasks
- `BUILD_UM` : Flag to compile our own UM executable
- `CALENDAR` : Calendar type (important for long climate simulations)
- `COMPUTE_ACCOUNT` : Your gadi `PROJECT` used for resource allocation
- `COMPUTE_HOST` : Name of supercomputer 
- `COMPUTE_QUEUE` : PBS job queue used for simulations
- `CONFIG_MODULE_NAME` : Extra module configuration data
- `CORE` : Type of CPU used in supercomputer environment
- `DATES` : List of dates to run simulations for
- `EXTRACT_HOST` : operating system type
- `HOUSEKEEP`: Flag to set housekeeping tasks
- `OCEANDIR` : Location of Ocean data
- `PPN` : Number of processors (generic)
- `QUEUE_PARALLEL` : PBS job queue type
- `RUNTYPE` : Flag for 'coupled' (modeling both the ocean and atmosphere) or 'uncoupled' (atmosphere only) simulation. 
- `SITE` : String to denote the supercomputer type
- `STOCHASTIC`: Flag for stochastic atmospheric physics
- `TASKLENGTH` : Data for UM task control
- `TASK_RUN` : Data for UM task control
- `TASK_TESTS` : Flag for UM task control
- `UMDIR` : Master directory for UM files
- `UM_RESOLUTION` : Global atmospheric resolution 
- `USE_COMORPH` : Flag for CoMorph convection scheme
- `USE_DOUBLE_PREC` : Flag for numerical precision
- `xios_path` : Directory of `xios` libraries used by intel compilers. XIOS is an XML input/output server used to handle coupling between the UM atmosphere and the NEMO ocean model.
- `oasis3_mct_path` : Directory of intel libraries to compile this version of the UM which supports the `oasis3` coupler.

:::{warning}

The default value of `ARCHDIR` is `/scratch/${PROJECT}/${USER}/GC5_runs`. This directory `/scratch/${PROJECT}/${USER}/` must exist and you must have write permissions to it, otherwise your outputs won't be saved. The value of the `bash` environment variable `PROJECT` is set in the `.config/gadi-login.conf` file in your home directory. This is your 'default' `gadi` project. See [here](https://opus.nci.org.au/spaces/Help/pages/230490489/FAQ...#FAQ...-'Permissiondenied'messagewhenworkingonanewproject.1) for more information.

You can always manually edit the value of `ARCHIDIR` to override the value of `PROJECT` if you want. Just remember to `reload` the `rose` suite again to update the definitions used in the `~/cylc-run` directory.
:::

### Task flow ###

Let's walk through the `suite.rc` file to determine the task flow. 

Before we get to the `graph` section, there are several `jinja` macros (defined using `{% %}` constructs) that do the following:
- Set an alias for the rose `TASK_RUN_COMMAND`
- load the required `modules` on gadi
- Set some run-time options based on entries in the `rose-suite.conf` file, including:
    - Numerical precision 
    - Archiving frequency
    - 'CoMorph' convection scheme
    - Stochastic physics settings
- Set aliases for dates based on the input `DATES`
- Set the ensemble number to zero. This suite was originally designed to handle ensemble forecasting and there is ensemble logic embedded in many tasks and scripts. For simplicity's sake, we have removed all the ensemble looping logic and just run the control forecast, i.e `I = 000`.

The `[cylc]` namespace is for all non task-related configurations. Here we set `UTC` mode to true. The `[events]` namespace allows us to sent notification emails after shutdown.

In the `[scheduling]` namespace we define the number of cycle points based on the input dates. In this example, we only run a single forecast date : "20200116T00"

In the `[dependencies]` namespace, we first define the graph to tasks that occur only once : `fcm_make_um`, `install_ancil`, `install_cold`, `fcm_make_drivers` and `fc_make2_drivers`.

We then use a `jinja` macro to loop over all possible to dates to define the tasks that run for every forecast date: `um_recon`, `um_forecast`, `convpp`, `rose_arch` and `housekeep`.

The `jinja` macro is defined using `{%- for date in SDATES : %}` and `{%- endfor %}`.

Within this loop, the `[^]` syntax is `cylc` shorthand for 'the initial cycle point', see:

https://cylc.github.io/cylc-doc/7.8.8/html/suite-config.html#referencing-the-initial-and-final-cycle-points

The `[runtime]` namespace then defines the environment variables and PBS job parameters for each task.  The `[root]` namespace defines common variables and parameters used by most scripts.  

Next, there are namespaces for each separate family of tasks. The `[ARCHIVE]` namespace defines the value for `ARCHDIR` defined in `rose-suite.conf`.

Below that, there are several dictionaries and macros used to define PBS queue and resource requirements for a given resolution. The two main computational tasks in the suite are the UM 'Reconfiguration' task, and the UM atmospheric forecast task. By default, this suite runs at the lowest available resolution (n320e). The `jinja` dictionary `UM_RES` will return a 10-minute PBS job walltime (`"PT10M"`) to the `cylc` variable `RCF_WALL` and a 4-hour job walltime (`"PT4H"`)to the variable `ATM_WALL`. Other variables are used with the `jinja` macro `node` to provide the number of compute nodes for the reconfiguration (`NODE_RCF`) and atmospheric forecast (`NODE_ATM`) tasks respectively.

The `[UM]` and `[RECONFIGURE]` namespaces then specify the resources for each task. Below this, there are separate namespaces (in lower case) for each specific task. Each task will inherit environmental parameters defined in the earlier sections.

This `suite.rc` file uses an include statement `%include site/nci_gadi.rc` to include information specific to gadi. When the suite is run, the contents of `site/nci_gadi.rc` will be included in the overall `suite.rc` file that is copied to the run directory `~/cylc-run/u-dl058`. 

For brevity's sake, we won't examine the contents of every namespace within `site/nci_gadi.rc`. But we will note the contents of this file which provides information such as:
- PBS walltime limits
- PBS compute queue
- PBS memory requirements
- PBS storage requiremetns
- Lists of modules to be loaded
- location of ancillary files
for each task environment.

You can see how the suite runs by executing 
```
$ rose suite-run -- --mode=simulation
```
from your `~/roses/u-dl058` directory. This command will run through each task in a 'simulated mode' without actually submitting a PBS job. 

:::{note}

Make sure you log into into your persistent session and load your `cylc` modules first before trying to run a `rose/cylc` suite!
:::

The graph of the suite looks like this.

![UM task graph ](images/flow.png)

### Task summaries

Below is a summary of each task. Each task is called using the commands placed in the `suite.rc` `[root]` namespace, i.e.
```
env-script = eval $(rose task-env)
script = {{TASK_RUN_COMMAND}}
```
where `TASK_RUN_COMMAND` is defined using the `jinja` macro
```
{% set TASK_RUN_COMMAND = "rose task-run --verbose -O '(" + SITE + ")'" %}
```
The use of `rose task-run` was covered in the third rose tutorial we covered earlier. If you need refresh your memory, you can review the tutorial here:

https://metomi.github.io/rose/2019.01.8/html/tutorial/rose/suites.html

which states "When run, rose task-run searches for an application with the same name as the Cylc task in the app/ directory."

## Running the suite

Let's manually run through each task in this suite, now that we know the order in which tasks are created via the graph above. We can run the suite in `hold` mode and manually trigger each task. Type
```
$ rose suite-run -- --hold

```
in your `~/rose/u-dl085` directory. This will bring up the suite where each task family is coloured in pink. Left-click on the arrows of each task family to expand them.

![UM task graph ](images/hold.png)

Now right-click on `install_ancil` and then left-click `Trigger -> Run now`.

![Triggering a UM task ](images/trigger.png)

#### install_ancil

This task is run from the `app/install_ancil/` directory. It builds symbolic links between the ancillary files located in the `${UM_ANCIL_DIR}/${GL_UM_RES}` directory on gadi and your local `cylc` working directory `$ROSE_DATA/etc/ancil_gl/`.

The full list of ancillary files required is contained in `app/install_ancil/rose-app.conf`.

When this task completes, the directory `~/cylc-run/u-dl058/share/data/etc/ancil_gl/`will be populated with symbolic links to all the ancillary files.

You can right-click on the task again (which will turn grey after it has successfully) and view the `job.out` file. The `cylc` scheduler will nicely capture all the PBS standard output and collate it into the `job.out` file.

![Job output](images/job.png)

:::{note}

Remember you can also look at the job outputs manually. The latest output for this task will be located at
`
~/cylc-run/u-dl058/log/job/20200116T0000Z/install_ancil/NN/job.out 
`
:::

Let's follow the same method and trigger all the remaining tasks in sequence.

#### install_cold

This task uses the `bash` script `app/install_cold/bin/install_ver.sh`. It will install 
`~/cylc-run/u-dl058/share/data/etc/um_vertlevs` to define the vertical levels of our grid.

It will also link the directory `~/cylc-run/u-dl058/share/fcm_make_surf` to a directory on gadi with files associated with the UM's land-surface model 'JULES'.

#### fcm_make_drivers

This task uses the script `app/fcm_make_drivers/` to populate the following directories with `python` files used to compile the `UM`.
- `~/cylc-run/u-dl058/share/fcm_make_drivers/mirror/`
- `~/cylc-run/u-dl058/share/fcm_make_drivers/extract/`

#### fcm_make2_drivers

This repeats the same script but with different environment variables to create and populate the following directories with `python` files used to compile the `UM`.
- `~/cylc-run/u-dl058/share/fcm_make_drivers/build/`

#### retrieve_atmos

This task is launched using `bin/retrieve_atmos_startdumps.sh`. It will copy a 'UM' atmospheric start-dump to `~/cylc-run/u-dl058/share/cycle/20200116T0000Z/`

The start dump file `20200116T0000Z_engl_t+3_000` is a 'UM' 'PP' file, i.e. a fortran binary record file created by the 'UM' itself. You will not be able to view it with a netCDF reader, but you can use the `xconv` utility to view it on gadi.
```
$ module use /g/data/access/modules/
$ module load xconv
$ xconv 20200116T0000Z_engl_t+3_000 &
```
This file is very large (17 Gb!) and it contains both single-level and multi-level variables on a global 1280x 960 grid, with up to 71 levels.

If you plot the surface air temperature using `xconv` you should generate the following image.

![Start dump](images/dump.png)

You can also load 'UM' files using the `ants` and `iris` python modules (developed by the UK Met Office) which are included in the CLEX/ACCESS-NRI `analysis3` python environment on gadi.
```python
import ants
import xarray as xr

# This will return a list of iris cube objects
dump = ants.load('20200116T0000Z_engl_t+3_000')

# This will extract the cube for surface temperature
temp, = [ cube for cube in dump if cube.standard_name == 'surface_temperature' ]

# This will convert the cube into an Xarray object
temp_da = xr.DataArray.from_iris(temp)

# A simple plot
temp_da.plot()
```
![Start dump_da](images/temp_da.png)

This dump file will serve as the initial condition for out atmospheric forecast.

#### fcm_make_um

This task will compile a version of the 'UM' for us to run our forecast. It executes the files in `app/fcm_make_um` and creates outputs in `~/cylc-run/u-dl058/share/fcm_make_um`. The most important outputs are
- The UM atmospheric executable and wrapper scripts located in `~/cylc-run/u-dl058/share/fcm_make_um/build-atmos/bin/um-atmos`
- The UM reconfigure executable and wrapper scripts located in `~/cylc-run/u-dl058/share/fcm_make_um/build-recon/bin/um-atmos`

Some notes on the `fcm make` process are available here:
https://21centuryweather.github.io/UM_summary_docs/code.html#compilation

#### um_recon

This task uses the UM reconfigure executables to take all the input information already assembled (start-dumps, ancillary data) and 'reconfigure' it for the required target grid. Most of the time the reconfigure step is just a fancy name for regridding. The task uses the files in `app/um`. Note the `app/um/rose-app.conf` file has two `command` entries:
```
[command]
default=run_model
recon=um-recon
```
So the same configuration file can be used to run two different executables depending on the command specified by the `cylc` workflow engine. Note the `suite.rc` contains the following:
```
    [[um_recon]]
        inherit = UM, RCF_RESOURCE, RECONFIGURE
        script = {{TASK_RUN_COMMAND}} --command-key=recon
```

If you want to know more about the UM reconfiguration process, you click here: https://21centuryweather.github.io/UM_summary_docs/using.html#reconfiguration

The standard output (or 'stdout' for short) of the UM reconfigure executable is long and rather interesting. You can scroll through the stdout contained in the `um_recon` by accessing the `um_recon` `job.out` file, either via the `cylc` gui or using a file editor of choice. It is very common for `um_recon` to fail when running a new suite configuration for the first time. 
:::{tip}

Knowing where to find error messages in the `um_recon` task is very important, as reconfiguration errors are one of the most common sources of problems when building a new suite (especially a regional model) with the UM.
:::

Note how the reconfigure executable:
- Splits itself across various 'PEs' or 'Processing Elements'.
- The jobs is submitted 48 CPUs on gadi, although the UM only uses 36 because of the specification of `nproc_x` and `nproc_y`:
```
Parallel Reconfiguration using      36 procesor(s)
divided into a LPG with nproc_x=      6and nproc_y=      6
```
- It assigns various input files to `fortran Unit` numbers for reading. 
- It reads the land/sea mask file and uses that to define the output grid
```
IO: Open: /home/548/pag548/cylc-run/u-dl058/share/data/etc/ancil_gl/qrparm.mask on unit  12


Output grid

0    1  307200   3     0    30     1  LAND MASK (No halo) (LAND=TRUE)
CLOSE: File /home/548/pag548/cylc-run/u-dl058/share/data/etc/ancil_gl/qrparm.mask Closed on Unit 12
```
- It reads the input grid from the input startdump file `20200116T0000Z_engl_t+3_000`.
- It computes (on the new grid) all the required fields to begin an atmospheric forecast.
- It outputs these fields to `~/cylc-run/u-dl058/share/cycle/20200116T0000Z/umgla000.astart'.

Note the resolution of this `.astart` file is 640x480, i.e. all input fields have been regridded from the higher resolution start-dump grid to a much coarser grid which corresponds to the specified `n320` resolution.

Note `n320` refers to a spectral representation of global resolution. Some data in the UM is computed using spectral fields. See https://www.ecmwf.int/sites/default/files/elibrary/2016/17262-new-grid-ifs.pdf for more information. 

#### um_forecast

This task initialises the atmospheric forecast, using the same `app/um` files used by `um_recon`. Let's look through the stdout of the atmospheric forecast task, either via the `cylc` gui or using a file editor. It is very common when running a new suite configuration for the first time that the atmospheric forecast task may fail.
:::{tip}

Knowing where to find error messages in the `um_forecast` task is very important, as numerical errors encountered in the atmospheric forecast step are a common sources of problems when running the UM. 
:::
Note the atmospheric executable:
-  opens the `.astart` file.
```

```
- Outputs the maximum vertical velocity at this timestep. Often the forecast model will fail with large, unphysical maximum vertical velocities. Sometimes they can approach the speed of sound ;)  These 'grid-point storms' are often caused by incorrect or discontinuous data in regions of high orography. The lat/long co-ordinates of the maximum vertical velocity will help you locate bugs. The output of the minimum theta value may also be useful. For high resolution models of Australian region, the Papua New Guinea highlands is often a source of error. 
```

```
- The output of the the atmospheric model in this suite integrates forward in time in 12 minute intervals. 
- You can use the `bash` app `grep` to search for all the maximum timesteps in `job.out` and then extract the digits of the subsequent line, e.g.
```
$ grep -A 1 w_max job.out | grep -P '(^\d+)'
0.225E+01  40    139   64.1deg W    -23.8deg S    0.225E+01   40     0

```
etc.
This task ends by writing the following files in `~/cylc-run/u-dl058/share/cycle/20200116T0000Z/':
- `umglaa_pa000` to `umglaa_pa024` in six hourly intervals
- `umglaa_pb000` to `umglaa_pa024` in a 24 hourly interval
- `umglaa_pc000` to `umglaa_pc024` in a 24 hourly interval
- `en000_umgla.daily`
- `en000_umgla.ecyc`
- `en000_umgla.espec`
- `en000_umgla.trmm`
- `en000_umgla.toarad`

These are all UM binary 'pp' files containing a variety of atmospheric variables on various grids. The STASH settings in the UM namelists will determine which variables are output and at what frequency.

#### convpp

This task runs various scripts located in `app/convpp` to convert these 'pp' files to netCDF format. The converted netCDF files are located in `~/cylc-run/u-dl058/share/cycle/20200116T0000Z/nc'

#### rose_arch

This task uses scripts located in `app/rose_arch` to copy the netCDF files to the archive directory `ARCHDIR` specified in `rose-suite.conf`.

#### housekeep

This task runs a very simple command in `suite.rc`:
```
script = rm -r $ROSE_DATAC
```
which deletes the directory `/cylc-run/u-dl058/share/cycle/20200116T0000Z/`.

Congratulations! You've just run your first UM suite using `rose/cylc`

## Viewing the outputs

The suite will output the netCDF files to the location defined in `ARCHDIR` in the `rose-suite.conf` file, which by default is equal to
```
ARCHDIR='/scratch/${PROJECT}/${USER}/GC5_runs'
```

A simple python notebook to load the data in this and compare it other suite output is available at
