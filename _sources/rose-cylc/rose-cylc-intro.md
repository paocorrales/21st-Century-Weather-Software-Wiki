# Introduction to Rose/Cylc

Running an atmospheric simulation is a complex process, requiring co-ordination of many separate tasks. To co-ordinate these tasks, we requirer a job scheduler, or a **workflow engine**.

These tutorials assume:
1. You have an NCI account on `gadi`.
2. You can access a command-line terminal on `gadi` (either via an `ssh` session or using the `ARE` research environment)

If you don't have an any of the above, follow the links [here](../gadi/getting-started.md)

3. If using an `ssh` session, you have an X-Windows manager on your local client PC/laptop (either Windows, Mac or Linux) which allows you to interact with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) generated on `gadi` using the X-windows protocol.  Linux supports X-windows natively, Mac OS requires the installation of 'Xquartz'. 

See [here](../gadi/mac-stuff.md) for more information for Mac users.

Windows users have a variety of options. It's also suggested your `ssh` `.config` file contains the following entries:
```
Host *
  ServerAliveInterval 60
  ForwardX11 yes
  ForwardX11Trusted yes
  TCPKeepAlive no

Host gadi.nci.org.au
  HostName gadi.nci.org.au
  User <insert your username here>
```
This will help keep your X-windows session active in short periods when you are away from your keyboard.

4. You have, or in the process of obtaining, a UK Met Office Science Repository Service (MOSRS) account. If you haven't started this, please contact Heidi Nettelbeck at ACCESS-NRI (heidi.nettelbeck@anu.edu.au).
5. You have memberships to the following `gadi` projects:
    - `hr22`
    - `access`
    - `ki32`
    - `ki32_mosrs`

If you don't have membership to these `gadi` projects, click [here](https://opus.nci.org.au/spaces/DAE/pages/249495608/Prerequisites) to apply.

## Shell scripts and running jobs on Linux

Typically we run programs (or apps) on a linux computer using a shell scripts. We use the `bash` shell to interpret input from the command-line to execute programs.

If you are unfamiliar with the linux command command line, click below.

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

For example, if you login to `gadi` and type `ls -la`, at the command-line you are executing the program `ls` with the additional arguments `la`. The output of the program is then directed via standard output to your terminal.

We can then create bash 'scripts' which allows us to process multiple inputs and to automate tasks from the command line instead of having to type everything manually.  A bash script is simply a text file with a list of commands, that we give special permissions to, that allows the Linux operating system to execute it as a program.

If you want more familiarity with `bash`, there are many on-line tutorials and references available, e.g.:

https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/bash-scripting-tutorial-linux-shell-script-and-command-line-for-beginners/

or

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bash-scripting-introduction-to-bash-and-bash-scripting/

You can follow those tutorials on `gadi` but you will need to use a different text editor to `gedit` as it is not installed. You can use `vi` if you're familiar with it, otherwise you can use `nano` which will run inside a terminal window, or type `nedit &` to launch the `nedit` GUI text editor.  The `&` tells bash to run this job 'in background', which allows you to continue typing inputs via the command-line while the `nedit` window is active.

A deeper `bash` reference can be found here:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/bash-introduction/

Depending on your prior experience with Linux and `bash`, you may want to spend a few days working through these tutorials and examples to gain a better understanding of how `bash` commands and `bash` `ENVIRONMENT` variables work and familiarise yourself with the Linux directory structures on `gadi`.

</details>
<br />

Typically you will use `bash` scripts to execute programs required to simulate the atmosphere, whether these programs are pre-compiled executables (e.g. the Unified Model itself), python scripts for pre-processing or post-processing, or bash commands themselves.

When we execute programs from the gadi command-line, we are using an 'interactive' session. Typically this is used for small programs that require very few resources (i.e. memory, processors, disk space) and can be executed in a few seconds or minutes. The gadi login nodes (i.e. the external servers you connect to via `ssh`) are designed to support small tasks such as:
- Editing files, build programs, install software in your home/project space, etc.
- Download/upload small amount of data (a few GB)
- Run/test/debug programs:
  - Not exceeding 30-minute CPU cumulative time limit
  - Not exceeding 4GiB memory
- Submit and monitor PBS jobs

These guidelines are sourced from [Introduction to Gadi](https://opus.nci.org.au/spaces/Help/pages/144277624/Introduction+to+Gadi?preview=%2F144277624%2F363135031%2FNCI_i2g_202411.pdf)

For larger tasks, a super-computer uses a batch-scheduling system whereby `bash` scripts are submitted to a job scheduler queue with requests for memory, processors and storage. The job scheduler then processes each jobs when resources become available. 

The NCI supercomputer `gadi` uses the `PBS` job scheduler. Documentation is available here:

https://opus.nci.org.au/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=236880320

Note that documentation contains information on how to run an 'interactive' PBS job session on a gadi compute node, which will allow you to interactively edit files and run programs that exceed the capacity of the gadi login nodes. 

:::{tip}

The gadi compute nodes are not externally connected to the internet, so you won't be able to connect to gitlab or copy files from external sources when logged into a compute note.
:::

But, what if we have a complex set of tasks that must run in a particular sequence? Can we create a scheduler which processes `PBS` jobs in a user-specified workflow?  

## Task Scheduling for Atmospheric Simulation

A good example of a complex task that must run in a particular sequence is a historical atmospheric simulation.  Typically for a longer, multi-day simulation, the sequence of tasks involves:
1. Reading in a global or regional atmospheric analysis with the correct valid time.
2. Read in ocean and land data for the same valid times.
3. Read in atmospheric and land ancillary data (e.g. topography, soil types, vegetation fields, aerosols, rivers etc.)
4. (optional) - create 'lateral boundary conditions' by slicing an area of interest from a global or regional analysis.
5. Regrid the input data onto our domain of interest.
6. Run a short-term atmospheric forecast model using the above inputs.
7. Repeat this process for as many hours or days (or weeks, months or years!) that are required.

Continual repetition of this process requires the interaction of many separate tasks. We need a system which submits programs, monitors their progress, keeps track of the current time and executes each task according to an ordered set of dependencies (i.e some tasks cannot run until some upstream tasks have finished). 

In order to do this, we require what is known as a workflow engine, which is a fancy name for a task scheduler.  

## The Cylc work engine 

Recently, the New Zealand National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) developed its own task scheduler to handle its operational workflows - **cylc**. This scheduler was so elegant, powerful and (relatively) simple to use that it was adopted by the UK Met Office, who wrapped an external software layer - **rose** - around the `cylc` engine. 

Every time you run an atmospheric simulation using the UK Met Office's Unified Model ('UM'), you will be using `cylc`. All ACCESS simulations use the UM as its atmospheric model.

When we refer to `rose/cylc`, we are referring to a `rose` framework (which constitutes various GUI tools, scripts and namelists) which launches the `cylc` workflow engine.

To understand how `cylc` works, visit the documentation here:

https://cylc.github.io/cylc-doc/7.9.3/html/index.html

Note that `gadi` is still using an earlier version of `cylc` (7.9.3) so make sure you select the correct version of the documentation. Check the URL and the headers/banners on the pages themselves. The latest version of `cylc` (8.3.4) contains some significant differences. 

### First cylc tutorial ###

Let's run through the tutorial here: 

https://cylc.github.io/cylc-doc/7.9.3/html/tutorial.html

To launch `cylc` on `gadi` you need to load the `cylc` software into your interactive command-line session. You will also need to specify a 'persistent session' in order to load the `cylc` module. The best way to do this to to execute the following commands from a
`gadi` terminal:
```
$ persistent-sessions start cylc-test
```
:::{note}

Type everything after the `$` into your terminal's command line, i.e. don't include the `$`. In this document the `$` is used to distinguish commands you need to type (or copy from your browser) from contents of text files etc. You will notice that a `gadi` command line usually ends with a `$`, e.g.
```
<username>@gadi-login-01]$
```
:::
This should generate output containing the following:
```
session <random text string> running - connect using
  ssh cylc-test.<user-id>.<project>.ps.gadi.nci.org.au
```
We then need to add the name of this session to the contents of a text file `/.persistent-sessions/cylc-session`. We can do this using the `cat` command from the command line.
```
$ mkdir -p ~/.persistent-sessions
$ cat > ~/.persistent-sessions/cylc-session <<< cylc-test.<user-id>.<project>.ps.gadi.nci.org.au
```
:::{warning}

Make sure you insert your values of `<user-id>` and `<project`> into the above command. i.e replicate the output generated from your earlier `persistent-session start cylc-test` command.
:::

These commands use the `bash` program `cat` (short for 'catalogue') to create a text file called `cylc-session` in the directory `~/.persistent-sessions/` which will contain the text `DUMMY`.

Remember `~` is a `bash` short-cut which refers to your home directory on `gadi`.

Let's check the contents of this file are correct by using `more` at the command line.
```
$ more ~/.persistent-sessions/cylc-session
cylc-test.<user-id>.<project>.gadi.nci.org.au
```

You will learn more about 'persistent-sessions' in a later  [section](../mosrs/mosrs-intro.md##Persistent-sessions). When you are running UM jobs against specific `gadi` projects, you will need to specify more arguments for your when launching persistent sessions. But the session we have launched above ('cylc-test') will suffice for these tutorials.

Let's login to your new 'persistent-session' using `ssh`:
```
$ ssh -Y cylc-test.<user-id>.<project>.ps.gadi.nci.org.au
```

Then you can load the `cylc` software.
```
$ module use /g/data/hr22/modulefiles
$ module load cylc7
```
This should generate the following output:
```
Using the cylc session cylc-test<etc>

Loading cylc7/24.03
  Loading requirement: mosrs-setup/2.0.1
```

Follow the instructions in section 7.6 - 7.9 of the tutorial. Begin with

```
$ cylc import-examples /tmp
```

This will create a list of cylc examples files in 
```
~/cylc-run/examples
```

All your future `rose/cylc` tasks to run the `UM` will also be deployed in your `~/cylc-run` directory.

Let's run the 'Hello World' example. Go to the following path in `~/cylc-run` directory (the path is actually different to the official documentation):
```
$ cd ~/cylc-run/examples/7.9.7/tutorial/oneoff/basic
```
Using a text editor of your choice (`vi`, `nedit`, `nano`, `emacs`, `Microsoft VS Code`), copy the contents from the tutorial into a file named `suite.rc`.

You will need to copy the 'hello world' `suite.rc` file from tutorial section 7.9 available here:

https://cylc.github.io/cylc-doc/7.9.3/html/tutorial.html#hello-world-in-cylc

Once complete, if you examine the contents of this file using the bash command-line program `more`, it should resemble this: 
```
 $ more suite.rc 
[meta]
    title = "The cylc Hello World! suite"
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = "hello"
[runtime]
    [[hello]]
        script = "sleep 10; echo Hello World!"
```
The program `more` is similar to `cat` but it uses the space bar to quickly step through a file contents in the terminal, whereas `cat` dumps it all in one go.

Ok, let's run this from the command line by executing the following: 
```
$ cylc run
```

:::{note}

Make sure you are in the current working directory containing your `suite.rc` file, i.e. `~/cylc-run/examples/7.9.7/tutorial/oneoff/basic` to run a `cylc` suite.
:::

Your output should contain the following.
```
$ cylc run

Loading cylc7/24.03
  Loading requirement: mosrs-setup/2.0.1
            ._.

```
Congratulations! You've just run your first `cylc` suite. 

### Second cylc tutorial ###

Let's move onto another `cylc` tutorial, which is located in the `rose` documentation. This tutorial deals with creating graphs, i.e. how we dictate the sequence in which tasks are run. The version of `rose` currently running supported on `gadi` for ACCESS-UM experiments is `2019.01.7` so make sure you using the following URL : 

https://metomi.github.io/rose/2019.01.8/html/tutorial/cylc/scheduling/graphing.html

Let's follow the practical section at the bottom of that page.

:::{tip}

In you are starting this tutorial from a fresh login session, remember to login to your specified 'persistent session'. We have to use the following `module use` and `module load` commands to add `rose` and `cylc` to our paths on gadi inside the specific session.
```
$ module use /g/data/hr22/modulefiles
$ module load cylc7
```
:::
Back to the tutorial:
```
$ mkdir ~/cylc-run/graph-introduction
$ cd ~/cylc-run/graph-introduction
```
Create a `suite.rc` file in this directory using the template provided, and then create a task graph using the necessary syntax. When you execute
```
$ cylc graph .
```
the results show match the below image.

![Simple cylc graph](images/cylc-graph-tutorial.png)

Remember the '.' in a `bash` command means 'the current directory'. So the above command means `create a graph of the suite that exists in the current directory'.  

:::{tip}

Here is a web-link containing a review of all 'special characters' in `bash`:
https://www.howtogeek.com/439199/15-special-characters-you-need-to-know-for-bash/
:::

### Third cylc tutorial ###

Read through the information available here : 

https://metomi.github.io/rose/2019.01.8/html/tutorial/cylc/scheduling/integer-cycling.html

This tutorial is important as it explains how to build a suite that repeats the same sequence of tasks. For a weather or climate simulation, you will be running a set of 'UM' tasks that will need to be repeated every hour, six hours, every day, or every few days, depending on your problem. You may need to repeat these tasks for weeks, months, years or decades depending on your application.

Regardless of your application and temporal resolution, you will need to be acquainted with how `cylc` handles "cycling" or "repeating" workflows. This will help you understand how to diagnose errors in task flows should they arise, or how to add new tasks if required.

Run through the steps in the practical until your graph resembles the below images.

![Simple cylc cylcing graph](images/cylc-cycle-tutorial.png)

### Fourth cylc tutorial ###

Let's move onto the next tutorial which looks at date-time cycling, i.e. controlling task flow using real date-time objects. This is how your weather and climate `rose/cylc` suites will be controlled.

Access the fourth tutorial here:

https://metomi.github.io/rose/2019.01.8/html/tutorial/cylc/scheduling/datetime-cycling.html

Remember to load the `rose` and `cylc` executables into your current `gadi` environment using the `module load` commands.

:::{tip}

You can use the `bash` `alias` function to write a simple macro to load the `rose/cylc` environment with a simple command.
 e.g. in my `~/.bash_profile` file I declare the following:
 
 ```alias start_rose="module use /g/data/hr22/modulefiles;module load cylc7"```
 Then if I'm at the terminal and I want to use `rose/cylc` I can just type the following:
 ```
 $ start_rose
   Loading cylc7
      Loading requirement: mosrs-setup/2.0.1
```
:::

Work your way through the practical exercise, which in this case is a simple taskflow for weather forecasting.

Your final `cylc` graph should include the following sections:

![Simple cylc NWP graph 1](images/cylc-datetime1.png)
![Simple cylc NWP graph 2](images/cylc-datetime2.png)
![Simple cylc NWP graph 3](images/cylc-datetime3.png)

### Fifth cylc tutorial ###

Now that we understand how define a workflow in `cylc` as a sequence of tasks and dependencies, how do we determine what each task actually comprises?

In this section you will learn how to assign executables (e.g. `bash` scripts, python scripts, or UM binaries) to a task.

Read through the following tutorial : 

https://metomi.github.io/rose/2019.01.8/html/tutorial/cylc/runtime/introduction.html

You will also learn many important tasks including:
- How to run a complex suite 
- How to use the cylc GUI to monitor task flows within a suite
- Understand the `~/cylc-run/<suite-name>/` directory structure to find log files, temporary input and output files and ancillary data.

When running this sample suite, your cylc GUI will resemble the following (assuming you have activated "graph view" in the second view using the buttons in the toolbar).

![Simple cylc runtime](images/cylc-runtime-tutorial.png)

You can inspect other job log files, e.g the `get_rainfall` task, e.g.
```
 more log/job/20000101T0600Z/get_rainfall/NN/job.out 
Suite    : runtime-introduction
Task Job : 20000101T0600Z/get_rainfall/01 (try 1)
User@Host: pag548@pgregory.pag548.gb02.ps.gadi.nci.org.au

2024-10-28T05:54:42Z INFO - started
2024-10-28T05:54:43Z INFO - succeeded
```
:::{note}

In the `cylc` directory structure, the subdirectory `NN` will always point to the latest job submission number. Logfiles from previous job submission attempts are retained to help keep track of earlier failures. Keep this in mind when you have to repeat a job submission because earlier jobs failed because of an error. 
:::

### Sixth cylc tutorial ###

The next tutorial expands our `cylc` knowledge to include runtime configuration. How do we use `bash` environment variables to control the way the suite runs? E.g. can we use environment variables to specify the location of input data files?

Have a read through the following exercises, but **DO NOT** attempt the practicals.

https://metomi.github.io/rose/2019.01.8/html/tutorial/cylc/runtime/runtime-configuration.html

This tutorial is broken and will not run under `cylc7`. 

As mentioned earlier in the section on [running jobs on Linux](#shell-scripts-and-running-jobs-on-Linux) running on gadi, `cylc` is configured to use the `PBS` batch system to schedule jobs.

This tutorial describes how we can pass `PBS` job directives using `cylc` and discusses how to start, stop and restart `cylc` suites and individual `cylc` tasks. 

## Rose ##

Rose was created as a way to harness `cylc` to run the UM. Typically, it creates a directory `app` which contains `rose-application files` (e.g. `rose-app.conf`) which is a way to prescribe large amounts of input configuration data, e.g.
- Fortran namelists 
- `bash` environment variables

See https://cylc.discourse.group/t/dealing-with-long-list-of-environmental-variables/993/4 for an example.

### First Rose tutorial ###

Now we will construct our first `rose` suite to learn how `rose` uses configuration files to pass parameters (typically `bash` environment variables or `fortan` namelists) to tasks controlled by `cylc`.

A `rose` "application" is a rose configuration which executes a defined command.

Let's run through the exercises available here:

https://metomi.github.io/rose/2019.01.8/html/tutorial/rose/applications.html

Once your `rose` application has been complete, you should be able to execute it and generate outputs similar to those below.
```
$ rose app-run -C ../
[INFO] export CYLC_TASK_CYCLE_POINT=20171101T0000Z

```
If you plot the file `~/rose-tutorial/application-tutorial/run/map.html` it should resemble this:

![Map](images/map_html.png)

### Second Rose tutorial ###

In the next `rose` tutorial you will learn how to add metadata to a rose suite. Metadata has a variety of uses in a `rose` suite. Follow the exercises located below to find out what they are.

https://metomi.github.io/rose/2019.01.8/html/tutorial/rose/metadata.html

:::{note}

In this tutorial the command `rose config-edit &` is used to edit the rose suite. In most of the 21stCenturyWeather and ACCESS-NRI documentation, the short-cut `rose edit &` is used instead.
:::

At the conclusion of this tutorial, your `rose edit` window should look like this.

![meta](images/rose-metadata.png)

### Third Rose tutorial ###

In this tutorial you will bring all of your knowledge of `rose` and `cylc` together to start, stop and restart a fully integrated `rose/cylc` suite.

You will learn how to control the overall configuration of a `rose/cylc` suite using the `rose-suit.conf` file.

Follow the exercises contained in this link:

https://metomi.github.io/rose/2019.01.8/html/tutorial/rose/suites.html

:::{note}

This exercise refers to `Jinja2`. Jinja is a templating language, i.e. a way to create extensive ASCII (text) documents by using logic to loop over variables or parameters to prevent repetitive typing of repeated strings or text. The homepage for the Jinja project is here:
 
https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/

There is short review of how `Jinja` works here : https://metomi.github.io/rose/2019.01.8/html/tutorial/cylc/runtime/configuration-consolidation/jinja2.html. 

You don't have to do the tutorials, but just be conscious that whenever you see braces such as `{{ }}` in a `suite.rc` file, those braces surround a variable that will be replaced with Jinja. Likewise, Jinja logic such as `{% if ... %}` or `{% for ... }` within the `suite.rc` will be processed to produce the final `suite.rc.processed` file executed by `cylc` which is created in your `~/cylc-run/<rose-id>` runtime directory.
In conclusion, Jinja is a way for us to create very long `suite.rc` files by looping over input parameters.
:::

You will have to make the following changes to `suite.rc` to make the tutorial work. 
```
[jinja2:suite.rc]
    station="camborne", "heathrow", "shetland", "aldergrove","belmullet"
 ```
 Otherwise the suite will not run. It will fail will the following errors:
```
[INFO] install: suite.rc
[INFO] REGISTERED rose-suite-tutorial -> /home/548/pag548/cylc-run/rose-suite-tutorial
[FAIL] cylc validate -o /scratch/gb02/pag548/tmp/tmp45a3jD --strict rose-suite-tutorial # return-code=1, stderr=
[FAIL] ERROR, parameter station out of range: station=belmullet
```
This error can be tracked down using the `bash` command `grep` which searches for strings in ASCII (text) files.
```
$ grep belmullet *
grep: app: Is a directory
grep: bin: Is a directory
grep: lib: Is a directory
grep: meta: Is a directory
suite.rc:    [[get_observations<station=belmullet>]]
```
This tells you one of the tasks in `suite.rc` expects a station value of `belmullet`. So you can add it to the list of station variables defined in `rose-app.conf`. Another solution would be to remove the task `[[get_observations<station=belmullet>]]` from the `suite.rc` file.

To check the suite has been installed correctly, your `~/cylc-run/rose-suite-tutorial/` directory should contain the following:
```
$ ls ~/cylc-run/rose-suite-tutorial/
app  bin  lib  log  meta  share  suite.rc  work
```
Note the `suite.rc` file installed in your `~/cylc-run/rose-suite-tutorial/` directory now contains `jinja` directives appended to the beginning of the file.
```
$ more ~/cylc-run/rose-suite-tutorial/suite.rc 
#!jinja2
{# Rose Configuration Insertion: Init #}
{% set CYLC_VERSION="7.9.7" %}
{% set ROSE_ORIG_HOST="gadi-login-09.gadi.nci.org.au" %}
{% set ROSE_SITE="nci" %}
{% set ROSE_VERSION="2019.01.7" %}
{% set station="camborne", "heathrow", "shetland", "aldergrove","belmullet" %}
{% set ROSE_SUITE_VARIABLES={
    'CYLC_VERSION': CYLC_VERSION,
    'ROSE_ORIG_HOST': ROSE_ORIG_HOST,
    'ROSE_SITE': ROSE_SITE,
    'ROSE_VERSION': ROSE_VERSION,
    'station': station,
} %}
[cylc]
    [[environment]]
        CYLC_VERSION=7.9.7
        DOMAIN=-12,48,5,61
        RESOLUTION=0.2
        ROSE_ORIG_HOST=gadi-login-09.gadi.nci.org.au
```

You can skip the section about **Rose Bush** as this software is no longer available on `gadi`.

In the practical section complete section 1 but **DO NOT** attempt section 2 as the suite is missing a list of UK Met Office station data and will fail.

A few words about **Rosie**. Rosie is a tool for managing `rose` suites. You will use `rosie` commands to check-out existing `rose` suites (or "roses") to run your weather and climate experiments. 

If you are making major modifications and building new `rose` suites, you will be committing your new suites to the central "roses" repository using `rosie`.

Have a quick read through the documentation available here : https://metomi.github.io/rose/2019.01.8/html/tutorial/rose/rosie.html

There is no need to complete the practical.  We will use `rosie` in the next exercise to interface with the UK Met Office Science Repository Services (MOSRS) to check-out our next exercise.

## Other sources of information

The British National Centre for Atmospheric Science contains some useful hints, tips and trouble shooting for `rose/cylc`.

https://cms.ncas.ac.uk/rose-cylc-hints/

It also contains a searchable forum :

Documentation for an older `rose` version (2018.02.0) can be found here:

https://metomi.github.io/rose/2018.02.0/html/rose-single-page.html

That link contains a lot of good `rose` and `cylc` information in a single location. Some of the information is out-of-date.

It also contains some useful `rosie` information, e.g.
