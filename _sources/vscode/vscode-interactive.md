# Python VSCode Interactive

A new feature of VSCode is the Python 'Interactive' Window. As described [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support-py,) this allows to the work with a Jupyter-like code environment without having to start a JupyterLab notebook server.

So you can run a script in an `Interactive` window but use cells, combine markdown and do inline plotting. Select the this mode by hitting the pull-down menu from the top-right button.

Inside the interactive window, you can type code into cells, and plot in a 'Notebook-like' environment without having to run a Juypter Notebook server.
