# ERA5 Drought 

Monthly drought indices from 1940 to present derived from ERA5 reanalysis is a global reconstruction of drought indices from 1940 to present.

The dataset comprises two standardised drought indices:

*    the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI)
*    the Standardised Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI).

[Find ore information about this data set on the ECMWF cross data store](https://xds-preprod.ecmwf.int/datasets/derived-drought-historical-monthly?tab=overview)


### Data:

Only SPI data is available on Gadi for 3, 6 ad 12 months as accumulation periods from 1940 to present. 

**Standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index**

The standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index is defined as the deviation from the reference climate and expressed in standard deviations. It evaluates the atmospheric water supply (precipitation, P) against the atmospheric water demand (potential evapotranspiration, PET), calculated as (P–PET). Positive values indicate wet conditions, and negative values indicate dry conditions with respect to the reference climate.
