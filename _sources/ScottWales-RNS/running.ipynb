    "# Running the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Regional Nesting Suite](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/rmed/wiki/suites/nesting) is used to run one or more regional models nested inside each other, optionally with a global driving model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suite **u-cy369** has been set up to run our sample domain. Check out the suite with `rosie checkout u-cy369` and open it in `rose edit`. Make sure to set the SITE to `nci-gadi` in 'General Run Options'.\n",

    "## Driving Data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to drive the RNS. Not all options are enabled at NCI, talk to your local support if you would like to use a method that's not been ported.\n",
    "\n",
    "At NCI, you can choose one of:\n",
    " 1. Run a full global model\n",
    " 2. Run from ERA5\n",
    " 3. Run from a start dump and LBC files from a previous run\n",
    " \n",
    "### Global Model \n",
    "\n",
    "To drive with a full global model choose \"UM Global Model\", \"Re-run from analyses on disk\". You will need to provide an initial conditions file.\n",

    "\n",
    "### ERA5\n",
    "\n",
    "NCI have a mirror of ECMWF's ERA5 dataset. To drive the model with this data choose \"ECMWF forecast fields\", \"EC analysis/re-analysis\". You will need to create a set of ancillaries to convert the ERA5 data to UM format. These can be created with the RAS as an additional domain, they should be at 0.1 degree resolution and cover an area ~ 10 gridpoints larger than your target domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Settings:\n",
    " * **NCI_ERA5GRIB**: When true, runs a task to convert the ERA5 archive data to GRIB format readable by the model. Can be disabled if this has been done previously for this domain and time period\n",

    "To drive the model from an arbitrary previous UM run, provided it saved LBC data, choose \"UM global model\", \"use start dumps and LBC creation files on disk\". The files don't need to be created from a global model, e.g. you could use this option with archived BARRA initial and boundary conditions.\n",
